# Project Brief: StrideTrack

## 1. Project Title
StrideTrack (Work Edition)

## 2. Project Goal
To create a browser-based application that helps participants in a "Biggest Loser Challenge" (Work Edition) track their personal wellness goals, including weight loss, exercise, calorie tracking, and bonus challenges, with a system for scoring, progress monitoring, and competition management.

## 3. Challenge Overview
* **Duration**: 8–12 weeks
* **Participants**: Employees within a work environment.
* **Core Mechanics**: Participants earn weekly points across four categories.

## 4. Key Features & Functionality

### 4.1. Core Categories & Scoring
* **Weight Loss**:
    * Scoring based on percentage of body weight lost from starting weight.
    * Formula: `(Starting Weight - Current Weight) / Starting Weight * 100`.
    * Points allocated based on % lost (e.g., 1.0%+ = 10 points, 0% = 0 points).
    * Max Weekly Points: 10
* **Exercise**:
    * Tracking options: Number of workout sessions per week OR total minutes/effort per week.
    * Scoring based on activity frequency (e.g., 4+ sessions = 10 points) or minutes (e.g., 150+ min = 10 points).
    * Max Weekly Points: 10
* **Calorie Tracking**:
    * Points awarded solely for consistent daily logging of food (e.g., MyFitnessPal, Lose It!), not calorie targets.
    * Scoring based on days logged per week (e.g., 7/7 days = 5 points).
    * Max Weekly Points: 5
* **Bonus/Challenges**:
    * Optional weekly themed challenges for extra points (e.g., water intake, steps, no sugar, new healthy recipe).
    * Points allocated per challenge (e.g., +5 points for 2L water daily).
    * Max Weekly Points: 5

### 4.2. Total Weekly Scoring
* Maximum Weekly Score = 30 points

### 4.3. User Interaction & Tracking
* **Self-Reporting**: Participants will self-report their weekly progress by a set deadline (e.g., every Monday).
* **Data Capture**: A dedicated interface for users to input their weekly weight, exercise data, calorie logging consistency, and bonus challenge achievements.
* **Progress Monitoring**: A reporting interface for users to view their own progress over time.

### 4.4. Reporting & Leaderboards
* **Admin/Organizer View**: Ability to view aggregated data for all participants.
* **Leaderboard**: Display of participant scores, potentially including categories like:
    * Name
    * Weight Loss %
    * Exercise Points
    * Calorie Log Points
    * Bonus Points
    * Total Points

### 4.5. Prizes & Awards
* **Weekly Mini-Prizes**: Option for small weekly incentives.
* **Grand Prizes (End of Challenge)**:
    * 1st Place: Most total points.
    * 2nd Place: Highest % weight loss.
    * 3rd Place: Best streak (e.g., longest logging consistency).
* **Fun Awards**: (e.g., "Most Calories Tracked," "Step Master," "Most Improved").

## 5. Ground Rules
* **Private Weigh-Ins**: Verification by HR/Wellness Lead or trust-based.
* **Health First**: Emphasis on safe, sustainable methods.
* **No Shaming**: Focus on celebrating all progress.
* **Inclusivity**: Points achievable even without weight loss.
* **Teams Option**: Potential for grouping participants into teams.

    * Can verify weigh-ins (*process outside the application, but application should support verification status*).

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1. MVP Scope
*The following features are included in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):*
- Secure login for participants
- In-app user registration (sign-up) with email verification
- Weekly data submission: weight, exercise (sessions or minutes), calorie tracking, bonus challenges
- Personal dashboard: progress charts, weekly data table
- Challenge leaderboard: sortable, privacy-respecting names

### 4.3. Authentication & Registration Details
* **MVP**: Secure login using email/username and password. Users can register in-app via a sign-up form. Passwords are hashed in the database. Password reset is handled via a "Forgot Password" flow that sends a reset link to the user's email. Registration requires email verification via a link sent to the user's email. Authentication uses JWT tokens for session management. All API calls require a valid token in the Authorization header.
* **Post-MVP**: Social login and multi-factor authentication may be considered.

### 4.7. Registration User Story
* **US.Auth.3**: As a new participant, I want to be able to register for an account in the app so that I can join the challenge and track my progress.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * Registration form with fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password.
        * Email must be unique and valid.
        * Password must meet minimum security requirements.
        * Upon registration, user receives a verification email with a link.
        * User cannot log in until email is verified.
        * After verification, user can log in and access the app.
        * Error messages for duplicate email, weak password, or invalid input.

### 4.4. Data Capturing
* **US.DC.1**: As a participant, I want to be able to submit my current weight (and starting weight, if not already captured) weekly so that my weight loss progress can be calculated.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * Input field for weight (e.g., lbs or kg).
        * Date associated with the weight entry.
        * System calculates and displays % weight loss from starting weight.
* **US.DC.2**: As a participant, I want to be able to log my exercise activities weekly so that I can earn points.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * Option to select "sessions per week" (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4+).
        * Option to enter "minutes/effort per week" (e.g., 0-60, 60-89, etc.).
        * System calculates exercise points based on selected method.
        * **Refinement**: The chosen exercise tracking method (sessions vs. minutes) will be sticky, meaning it will apply for the entire duration of the challenge once selected by the participant during their first data submission.
* **US.DC.3**: As a participant, I want to be able to report my calorie tracking consistency weekly so that I can earn points for consistent logging.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * Input for "Days Logged" (e.g., 0-7).
        * System calculates calorie tracking points.
* **US.DC.4**: As a participant, I want to be able to indicate completion of weekly bonus challenges so that I can earn additional points.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * List of active weekly bonus challenges.
        * Checkbox or similar input for each challenge to mark as complete.
        * System calculates bonus points.
* **US.DC.5**: As a participant, I want to be able to submit all my weekly data by a set deadline (e.g., Monday 9 AM) so that my scores are included in the weekly tally.

### 4.5. Reporting & Leaderboards
* **US.R.1**: As a participant, I want to view a personal dashboard showing my progress over time (e.g., weight trend, total points accumulated, points per category per week).
* **US.R.2**: As a participant, I want to view the overall challenge leaderboard showing the ranking of all participants based on total accumulated points.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        * Display Name, Weight Loss %, Exercise Points, Calorie Log Points, Bonus Points, Total Points.
        * Option to sort by various columns (e.g., Total Points, Weight Loss %).
        * **Refinement**: Participant names on the leaderboard will be displayed as "First Name + Last Initial" (e.g., "John D.") for privacy.
* **US.R.3**: As a participant, I want to see how the points are calculated for each category so that I understand my score.

### 4.6. Administration (MVP)
* Admins can view all participant data, leaderboards, and export CSVs. Admins cannot edit user data directly in MVP. Verification of weigh-ins is tracked as a status field but managed outside the app.

## 5. Scoring Logic (Detailed)
* **Weight Loss Scoring**:
    * Formula: `(Starting Weight - Current Weight) / Starting Weight * 100`
    * Points:
        * 1.0%+ = 10 points
        * 0.8–0.99% = 8 points
        * 0.5–0.79% = 6 points
        * 0.2–0.49% = 4 points
        * 0.01–0.19% = 2 points
        * 0% = 0 points
* **Exercise Scoring**:
    * **Option 1 (Sessions)**:
        * 4+ workout sessions/week = 10 points
        * 3 sessions/week = 7 points
        * 2 sessions/week = 5 points
        * 1 session/week = 2 points
        * No workouts = 0 points
    * **Option 2 (Minutes/Effort)**:
        * 150+ minutes/week = 10 points
        * 120–149 min = 8 points
        * 90–119 min = 6 points
        * 60–89 min = 4 points
        * <60 min = 2 points
    * *System should allow participants to choose their preferred tracking method (sessions or minutes) at the start of the challenge or when first submitting exercise data. This choice will be sticky for the duration of the challenge.*
* **Calorie Tracking Scoring**:
    * Days Logged:
        * 7/7 days = 5 points
        * 5–6 days = 4 points
        * 3–4 days = 2 points
        * <3 days = 0 points
* **Weekly Bonus Challenges Scoring**:
    * Each specific challenge can award points (e.g., +5, +3).
    * Points are cumulative for completed challenges within the week.

## 6. Technical Requirements
* **Frontend**:
    * **Technology**: Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    * **Pages**:
        * Login Page: Secure user authentication.
        * Registration/Sign-up Page (if new users are created within the app).
        * Data Capturing Page: Intuitive forms for weekly data submission.
        * Personal Dashboard/Reporting Page: Charts and tables for individual progress.
        * Leaderboard Page: Dynamic table displaying challenge rankings.
        * Administrator Dashboard (New): Pages for viewing participant data, potentially with sorting, filtering, and export options.
    * **User Experience**: Responsive design for various screen sizes, intuitive navigation, clear feedback on data submission.
* **Backend & Database**:
    * **Database**: Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for storing:
        * User authentication data (hashed passwords).
        * Participant profiles (name, starting weight, *selected exercise tracking method*).
        * Weekly submitted data (weight, exercise logs, calorie logs, bonus challenge completions).
        * Calculated weekly and cumulative scores.
    * **API**: RESTful API for secure communication between frontend and backend.
    * **Security**: Implement industry-standard security practices for data at rest and in transit (e.g., HTTPS, encryption, input validation).

## 7. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
* User registration and profile management.
* Admin panel for managing challenges (e.g., setting up new challenges, customizing bonus tasks).
* Ability to form and track teams.
* Integration with external fitness trackers (e.g., Google Fit, Apple Health, Fitbit).
* In-app messaging or notification system.
* Gamification elements (badges, milestones).

## 8. Success Metrics

# Frontend Architecture: StrideTrack

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the high-level frontend architecture for the "StrideTrack" application. It defines the structural components, data flow, and technology choices to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and performant user interface that meets the requirements outlined in the PRD and UI/UX Specification.

## 2. Architectural Style
* **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: Given the need for dynamic data display (charts, leaderboards, real-time feedback on data entry), an SPA approach using a modern JavaScript framework is highly recommended. This provides a fluid user experience without full page reloads.
* **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, independent components (e.g., `LoginForm`, `WeightInput`, `LeaderboardTable`) will enhance maintainability, reusability, and development efficiency.

## 3. Technology Stack Recommendation

### 3.1. Core Framework/Library
* **Recommendation**: React, Vue.js, or Angular.
    * **React**: (Popular, robust ecosystem, strong community support, component-based, good for complex UIs).
    * **Vue.js**: (Easier learning curve, progressive adoption, good for small to medium applications, flexible).
    * **Angular**: (Comprehensive framework, opinionated, suitable for large enterprise applications).
* **Rationale**: These frameworks provide excellent tools for building interactive UIs, managing state, and integrating with APIs. The choice can depend on team familiarity and specific project needs, but any of these would be suitable. For this brief, we'll assume a **React-like component-based approach**.

### 3.2. State Management
* **Recommendation**:
    * **React Context API / Zustand / Jotai**: For React, lighter solutions for managing global state (e.g., user authentication status, challenge ID).
    * **Redux Toolkit**: For more complex global state needs, particularly if the application scales significantly.
    * **Vuex / Pinia**: For Vue.js.
    * **NgRx**: For Angular.
* **Rationale**: Centralized state management is crucial for data consistency across different components and pages (e.g., user profile, current weekly data, leaderboard data).

### 3.3. Routing
* **Recommendation**:
    * **React Router**: For React applications.
    * **Vue Router**: For Vue.js applications.
    * **Angular Router**: For Angular applications.
* **Rationale**: Essential for navigating between the Login, Data Capturing, Personal Dashboard, and Leaderboard pages within the SPA.

### 3.4. API Communication
* **Recommendation**: `fetch` API or `Axios` library.
* **Rationale**: For making HTTP requests to the backend RESTful API (e.g., for user login, submitting data, fetching leaderboard results). `Axios` offers more features like interceptors and better error handling out-of-the-box.

### 3.5. Styling
* **Recommendation**:
    * **CSS-in-JS (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion)**: For component-scoped styles, good for maintaining isolated styles.
    * **Utility-first CSS (e.g., Tailwind CSS)**: For rapid development and consistent design system.
    * **Sass/Less**: For more traditional CSS pre-processing.
* **Rationale**: A consistent and maintainable styling approach is vital for the application's visual appeal and future enhancements.

### 3.6. Charting Library
* **Recommendation**: Chart.js, Recharts (React), Nivo (React), Vue-chartjs (Vue).
* **Rationale**: To effectively visualize progress data on the Personal Dashboard (Weight Trend, Points Accumulation, Weekly Category Breakdown).

## 4. Component Breakdown (High-Level)

### 4.1. Layout Components
* `AppLayout`: Main layout container, including `Header` and `Footer` (if applicable).
* `NavigationBar`: Contains links to main sections (Dashboard, Submit Data, Leaderboard, Logout).

### 4.2. Page Components
* `LoginPage`: Handles user authentication.
    * `LoginForm` (sub-component)
* `DataCapturePage`: Manages weekly data submission.
    * `WeightInputForm`
    * `ExerciseInputForm`
    * `CalorieInputForm`
    * `BonusChallengesForm`
* `PersonalDashboardPage`: Displays individual progress.
    * `ProgressSummaryCard`
    * `WeightTrendChart`
    * `PointsAccumulationChart`
    * `WeeklyCategoryBreakdownChart`
    * `WeeklyDataTable`
* `LeaderboardPage`: Displays challenge rankings.
    * `LeaderboardTable`
    * `LeaderboardFilters` (if sorting/filtering is added)

### 4.3. Reusable UI Components
* `Button`
* `TextInput`
* `Dropdown`
* `Checkbox`
* `RadioGroup`
* `ChartContainer`
* `Table`
* `ErrorMessage`
* `SuccessMessage`
* `Spinner`

## 5. Data Flow (High-Level)
1.  **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI components (e.g., types in weight, clicks submit).
2.  **Component Event Handling**: Component triggers an action (e.g., `submitWeightData`).
3.  **State Management Action**: Action dispatches to update the application state (e.g., `SET_CURRENT_WEIGHT`).
4.  **API Call**: If data needs to be persisted or fetched, an asynchronous API call is made to the backend.
5.  **Backend Processing**: Backend validates data, performs calculations, and interacts with the database.
6.  **API Response**: Backend sends a response (success/failure, updated data).
7.  **State Update**: Frontend state is updated based on the API response.
8.  **UI Re-render**: Components re-render automatically to reflect the updated state.

## 6. Development Environment & Tooling
* **Package Manager**: npm or Yarn.
* **Build Tool**: Webpack (often integrated with frameworks like Create React App, Vue CLI, Angular CLI).
* **Version Control**: Git.
* **IDE**: VS Code (with relevant extensions).
* **Linting/Formatting**: ESLint, Prettier.
* **Testing**: Jest/React Testing Library (for React), Cypress/Playwright (for E2E).

## 7. Performance Considerations
* **Code Splitting**: Load only necessary code for each route/component.
* **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when they are needed.
* **Image Optimization**: Optimize any images used.
* **API Caching**: Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed, less volatile data.

## 8. Security Considerations
* **Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) for API calls.
* **Input Validation**: Frontend validation to provide immediate feedback, but always re-validate on the backend.
* **XSS/CSRF Protection**: Implement best practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
* **HTTPS**: Ensure all communication with the backend is over HTTPS.
